            <p>Reading books allow children to explore a world outside of their own.  Stories in any book one reads presents new experiences and feelings, and model problem solving example for children to reflect, model and refer to as they negotiate through life.  Book reading subtly teaches the reader and expands thoughts and perceptions.  Reading develops language.  Often new words are introduced in books that may be outside their daily exposure, expanding their vocabulary.  In addition, listening to and reading books builds children reading strategies and phonics understanding, which will serve them in their academic experience and their personal enjoyment.</p>
