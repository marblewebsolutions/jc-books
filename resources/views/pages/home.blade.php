            <p><span class="bold large-text">Welcome to Cawood Books.</span>  Creating stories has always been a passion of mine and I am finally taking the time to navigate the publishing process.  I look forward to publishing multiple children’s picture books in the next several years.</p>

            <p class="mt-med">It is my hope to get as many books in the hands of children as I can.  With this goal, I understand that many are not as fortunate to be able to afford their own books.  With this in mind, I am pledging to donate one book for every five books sold. I will distribute to area schools and community centers, contacting their social workers or coordinators to ensure distribution of the donated books go to children who may benefit the most from receiving it.</p>
    
            <p class="mt-med">I hope you enjoy previewing my first book, Ants in the Pants Dance! This rhyming story about a young boy with some uninvited guests in his picnic is engaging and fun!  This book is ideal for children ages 3-10.</p>
    
            <p class="mt-med">Look for my next book, Mirabelle the Butterfly to be released in early 2019.  Mirabelle is a young elephant who is determined to become a butterfly.  This enduring tale of belief in oneself appeals to a younger audience between the ages of 3-7.</p>
