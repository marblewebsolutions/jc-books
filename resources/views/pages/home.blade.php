            <p><span class="bold large-text">Welcome to Cawood Books.</span>  Creating stories has always been a passion of mine and I am finally taking the time to navigate the publishing process. I look forward to publishing multiple children’s picture books in the next several years.</p>

            <p class="mt-med">It is my hope to get as many books in the hands of children as I can. With this goal, I understand that many are not as fortunate to be able to afford their own books. With this in mind, I am pledging to donate one book for every five books sold. I will distribute to area schools and community centers, contacting their social workers or coordinators to ensure distribution of the donated books go to children who may benefit the most from receiving it.</p>
    
            <p class="mt-med">I hope you enjoy previewing my first book, Ants in the Pants Dance! This rhyming story about a young boy with some uninvited guests in his picnic is engaging and fun! This book is ideal for children ages 3-10.</p>
    
            <p class="mt-med">Look for my next two books, Mirabelle the Butterfly and Finnegan’s Tale to be released in in 2019. Both books will appeal to children between the ages of 2-8.  Mirabelle the Butterfly is an enduring tale of belief in oneself as readers follow a young elephant’s journey to become a butterfly Finnegan’s Tale is an adventurous rhyming story of a mouse who desires more excitement in his life.  He seizes the opportunity one day and readers follow his exciting escapades that take him to great heights!</p>

            <p class="list-item">Since <i>Ants in the Pants Dance’s</i> September 2018 launch, I have had the opportunity to read to hundreds of children through book reads and several author’s visits to schools.  This coming summer, I plan to do more author reads at book stores and libraries around the great state of Michigan. I’ll make sure to add them to this section. Keep your eyes open for a book read and stop on by!</p>
            
            <p class="list-item mt-med">Because of the success of <i>Ants in the Pants Dance</i>, I have been able to honor my mission of donating a book for every five books sold.  Recipients of the books include children in the Lansing School District, Detroit Public Consolidated Schools and an upcoming donation to Flint Public Schools.  As the result, over 300 books will be in the hands of children who otherwise may be unable to purchase <i>Ants in the Pants Dance</i>. Thank you to those who have purchased <i>Ants in the Pants Dance</i> for your support with making this happen.</p>
            
            <p class="list-item mt-med"><i>Mirabelle the Butterfly</i> is currently being illustrated by inspirational artist, Matthew McDaniel. Matthew is beautifully capturing Mirabelle’s gentle determination and her enduring essence, helping to weave storyline and imagery into a memorable tale. I feel so thankful because each time I think about the book, I know Mirabelle and her story has been brought to life through this talented artist’s vision.

            <p class="list-item mt-med"><i>Finnegan’s Journey</i> is in the storyboard stage of development, teaming up with Michigan artist, Kelly Burdgick. It is exciting for me to note that Kelly is also my cousin. We share a passion to create appealing stories for children. I feel so blessed to be able to work with Kelly, with whom I have shared a lifespan of memories.  The process of watching Finnegan’s adventure come to life through her creative lens is beyond exciting!  Keep up with the site for updates!</p>
